                                The project consisted of an altered form of mancala and a min-max algorithm in a Jupyter Notebook.
                                Recently, my girlfriend and I have been playing a lot of mancala, and I have been losing so badly!

                                Currently implemented, however, is a Streamlit application that displays the win rates of random opponent vs. random opponent and random opponent vs. bot opponent (in real-time!)

                                    The Strava API was extremely difficult to use due to obscure formatting and stringent token limitations.
