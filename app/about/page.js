          Hello {`ãƒ„` } I am a recent graduate from the University of Colorado Boulder with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
          This summer I am continuing my education here in Boulder where I am beginning my Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering.
          <br /><br />
          I am extremely passionate about using technology and software to solve challenges in our healthcare and medical system.
          I'm an intern at The Cigna Group, where I work with big data and am currently learning Rust ðŸ¦€. 
          <br /><br />
          During my free time, I enjoy cycling, my girlfriend and I love to train our dog Gary, and I listen to a lot of music.
